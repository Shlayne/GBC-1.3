Originally, this was just me following along with The Cherno's game engine, Hazel. However since then, I have found myself wanting to do other things that they were not doing, i.e. Joystick/Gamepad input. My original goal is still here however: to be able to start GBC and make something with it. Whether that something be PainTrainMark4, Visualizer4D, or something else entirely will be up for debate for future me. But for now, I still have work to do, and work I shall.
